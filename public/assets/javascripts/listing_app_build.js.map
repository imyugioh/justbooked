Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\n * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\n * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {(state) => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm A fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\n * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\n * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `ENTERING`\n *  - `ENTERED`\n *  - `EXITING`\n *  - `EXITED`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\n * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\n * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\n * it's complete. Let's take the following example:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * state= { in: false };\n *\n * toggleEnterState = () => {\n *   this.setState({ in: true });\n * }\n *\n * render() {\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={this.state.in} timeout={500} />\n *       <button onClick={this.toggleEnterState}>Click to Enter</button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state and\n * stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) when finally switches to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n */\n\nvar Transition = function (_React$Component) {\n  _inherits(Transition, _React$Component);\n\n  function Transition(props, context) {\n    _classCallCheck(this, Transition);\n\n    var _this = _possibleConstructorReturn(this, _React$Component.call(this, props, context));\n\n    var parentGroup = context.transitionGroup;\n    // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ?

Like with the `<Transition>` component, `<TransitionGroup>`, is a\n * state machine for managing the mounting and unmounting of components over\n * time.\n *\n * Consider the example below using the `Fade` CSS transition from before.\n * As items are removed or added to the TodoList the `in` prop is toggled\n * automatically by the `<TransitionGroup>`. You can use _any_ `<Transition>`\n * component in a `<TransitionGroup>`, not just css.\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import TransitionGroup from 'react-transition-group/TransitionGroup';\n *\n * class TodoList extends React.Component {\n *   constructor(props) {\n *     super(props)\n *     this.state = {items: ['hello', 'world', 'click', 'me']}\n *   }\n *   handleAdd() {\n *     const newItems = this.state.items.concat([\n *       prompt('Enter some text')\n *     ]);\n *     this.setState({ items: newItems });\n *   }\n *   handleRemove(i) {\n *     let newItems = this.state.items.slice();\n *     newItems.splice(i, 1);\n *     this.setState({items: newItems});\n *   }\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <div>\n *         <button onClick={() => this.handleAdd()}>Add Item</button>\n *         <TransitionGroup>\n *           {this.state.items.map((item, i) => (\n *             <FadeTransition key={item}>\n *               <div>\n *                 {item}{' '}\n *                 <button onClick={() => this.handleRemove(i)}>\n *                   remove\n *                 </button>\n *               </div>\n *             </FadeTransition>\n *           ))}\n *         </TransitionGroup>\n *       </div>\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Note that `<TransitionGroup>`  does not define any animation behavior!\n * Exactly _how_ a list item animates is up to the individual `<Transition>`\n * components. This means you can mix and match animations across different\n * list items.\n */\n\nvar TransitionGroup = function (_React$Component) {\n  _inherits(TransitionGroup, _React$Component);\n\n  function TransitionGroup(props, context) {\n    _classCallCheck(this, TransitionGroup);\n\n    // Initial children should all be entering, dependent on appear\n    var _this = _possibleConstructorReturn(this, _React$Component.call(this, props, context));\n\n    _this.handleExited = function (key, node, originalHandler) {\n      var currentChildMapping = (0, _ChildMapping.getChildMapping)(_this.props.children);\n\n      if (key in currentChildMapping) return;\n\n      if (originalHandler) originalHandler(node);\n\n      _this.setState(function (state) {\n        var children = _extends({}, state.children);\n\n        delete children[key];\n        return { children: children };\n      });\n    };\n\n    _this.state = {\n      children: (0, _ChildMapping.getChildMapping)(props.children, function (child) {\n        var onExited = function onExited(node) {\n          _this.handleExited(child.key, node, child.props.onExited);\n        };\n\n        return (0, _react.cloneElement)(child, {\n          onExited: onExited,\n          in: true,\n          appear: _this.getProp(child, 'appear'),\n          enter: _this.getProp(child, 'enter'),\n          exit: _this.getProp(child, 'exit')\n        });\n      })\n    };\n    return _this;\n  }\n\n  TransitionGroup.prototype.getChildContext = function getChildContext() {\n    return {\n      transitionGroup: { isMounting: !this.appeared }\n    };\n  };\n  // use child config unless explictly set by the Group\n\n\n  TransitionGroup.prototype.getProp = function getProp(child, prop) {\n    var props = arguments.length > 2 && arguments[2] !== undefined ?
