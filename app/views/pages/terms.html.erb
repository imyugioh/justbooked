          PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY AS THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES AND OBLIGATIONS. THESE INCLUDE VARIOUS LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS, A CLAUSE THAT GOVERNS THE JURISDICTION AND HOME OF DISPUTES, AND OBLIGATIONS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS.</p>
        <p>
          IN PARTICULAR, CHEFS SHOULD UNDERSTAND HOW THE LAWS WORK IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CITIES. SOME CITIES HAVE LAWS THAT RESTRICT THEIR ABILITY TO COOK FOR PAYING USERS FROM FACILITIES AND AREAS THAT AREN’T INSPECTED OR WITHIN THE PROPER ZONING AREAS FOR COOKING AND SELLING FOOD. THESE LAWS ARE OFTEN PART OF A CITY'S ZONING OR ADMINISTRATIVE CODES. IN MANY CITIES, CHEFS MUST REGISTER, GET A PERMIT, OR OBTAIN A LICENSE BEFORE LISTING A MEAL PACKAGE OR ACCEPTING ORDERS FROM USERS. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS VARY GREATLY IN HOW THEY ENFORCE THESE LAWS. PENALTIES MAY INCLUDE FINES OR OTHER ENFORCEMENT. CHEFS SHOULD REVIEW LOCAL LAWS BEFORE LISTING A MEAL PACKAGE ON JUST BOOKED. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU HEREBY AGREE THAT YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OPERATING YOUR BUSINESS WITH THE PROPER CERTIFICATIONS, LICENSES, AND OR PERMITS WITHIN YOUR CITY. OPERATING ON JUST BOOKED WITHOUT BEING REGISTERED, PERMITTED OR CERTIFIED TO COOK AND SELL FOOD WILL RESULT IN IMMEDIATE TERMINATION, AND REMOVAL FROM JUST BOOKED.

          Eligibility</p>

          The Site, Application and Services are intended solely for persons who are 18 or older. Any access to or use of the Site, Application or Services by anyone under 18 is expressly prohibited.

        </p>
        <p>
          How the Site, Application and Services Work</p>
        <p>
          The Site, Application and Services can be used to facilitate the listing and Order of food and/or beverage packages ("Meal Packages"). Such Meal Packages are included in Listings on the Site, Application and Services by Chefs. You may view Listings as an unregistered visitor to the Site, Application and Services; however, if you wish to book a Meal Package or create a Listing, you must first register to create an Just Booked Account (defined below).
        </p>
        <p>
          <a name="_GoBack"></a> As stated above, Just Booked makes available an marketplace with related technology for Users and Chefs to meet online and arrange for Orders of Meal Packages directly with each other. Just Booked is not an owner or creator of the Meal Packages, or facilities in which in which Meal Packages are created, nor is it a direct provider of Meal Packages. Unless explicitly specified otherwise in the Just Booked marketplace, Just Booked's responsibilities are limited to: (i) facilitating the availability of the Site, Application and Services and (ii) serving as the limited payment collection agent of each Chef for the purpose of accepting payments from Users on behalf of the Chef. Just Booked is not responsible for any liability associated with the purchasing and consumption of Meal Packages.
        </p>
        <p>
          PLEASE NOTE THAT, AS STATED ABOVE, THE SITE, APPLICATION AND SERVICES ARE INTENDED TO BE USED TO FACILITATE Chefs AND USERS CONNECTING AND ORDER PACKAGES DIRECTLY WITH EACH OTHER. Just Booked CANNOT AND DOES NOT CONTROL THE CONTENT CONTAINED IN ANY LISTINGS AND THE CONDITION, LEGALITY OR SUITABILITY OF ANY PACKAGES. Just Booked IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY AND ALL LISTINGS AND PACKAGES. ACCORDINGLY, ANY ORDERS WILL BE MADE OR ACCEPTED AT THE MEMBER'S OWN RISK.
        </p>
        <p>
          Account Registration

You may register to join the Services directly via the Site or Application or as described in this section.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also register to join by logging into your account with certain third-party social networking sites ("SNS") (including, but not limited to, Facebook; each such account, a "Third-Party Account"), via our Site or Application, as described below. As part of the functionality of the Site, Application and Services, you may link your Just Booked Account with Third-Party Accounts, by either: (i) providing your Third-Party Account login information to Just Booked through the Site, Services or Application; or (ii) allowing Just Booked to access your Third-Party Account, as permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third-Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third-Party Account login information to Just Booked and/or grant Just Booked access to your Third-Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein), without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account and without obligating Just Booked to pay any fees or making Just Booked subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third-party service providers. By granting Just Booked access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that Just Booked will access, make available and store (if applicable) any Content that you have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account ("SNS Content") so that it is available on and through the Site, Services and Application via your Just Booked Account and Just Booked Account profile page. Unless otherwise specified in these Terms, all SNS Content, if any, will be considered to be Member Content for all purposes of these Terms. Depending on the Third-Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third-Party Accounts will be available on and through your Just Booked Account on the Site, Services and Application. Please note that if a Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or Just Booked's access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-party service provider, then SNS Content will no longer be available on and through the Site, Services and Application. You have the ability to disable the connection between your Just Booked Account and your Third-Party Accounts, at any time, by accessing the "Settings" section of the Site and Application. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. Just Booked makes no effort to review any SNS Content for any purpose, including but not limited to for accuracy, legality or non-infringement and Just Booked is not responsible for any SNS Content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your Just Booked Account and your Just Booked Account profile page will be created for your use of the Site and Application based upon the personal information you provide to us or that we obtain via an SNS as described above. You may not have more than one (1) active Just Booked Account. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. Just Booked reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Just Booked Account and your access to the Site, Application and Services if you create more than one (1) Just Booked Account, or if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, fraudulent, not current or incomplete. You are responsible for safeguarding your password. You agree that you will not disclose your password to any third party and that you will take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your Just Booked Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions.

        </p>
        <p>
          Meal Package Listings</p>
        <p>
          As a Member, you may create Listings. To create a Listing, you will be asked a variety of questions about the Meal Package to be listed, including, but not limited to, the location, serving size, menu served, beverages provided if, and availability of the Meal Package and pricing and related rules and financial terms. In order to be featured in Listings via the Site, Application and Services, all Meal Packages must have valid physical addresses. Listings will be made publicly available via the Site, Application and Services. Other Members will be able to book your Meal Package via the Site, Application and Services based upon the information provided in your Listing. You understand and agree that once a User requests a Order of your Meal Package, you may not request the User to pay a higher price than in the Order request.
        </p>
        <p>
          You acknowledge and agree that you alone are responsible for any and all Listings and Member Content you post. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the Order of a Meal Package in a Listing you post (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties, such as homeowners association, condominium, lease or rental agreements, and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws and restrictions (such as Food and Safety and FDA approved ingredients), Tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Meal Package included in a Listing you post (including having all required permits, licenses and registrations), and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties. Please note that Just Booked assumes no responsibility for a Chef's compliance with any agreements with or duties to third parties, applicable laws, rules and regulations. Just Booked reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that Just Booked, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or Just Booked's then-current Policies and Community Guidelines, or otherwise harmful to the Site, Application or Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a Chef, you understand and agree that Just Booked does not act as an insurer or as your contracting agent. If a User requests a Order of your Meal Package and consumes your Meal Package, any agreement you enter into with such User is between you and the User and Just Booked is not a party to it. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Just Booked serves as the limited authorized payment collection agent of the Chef for the purpose of accepting, on behalf of the Chef, payments from Users of such amounts stipulated by the Chef (including delivery or other fees and/or Taxes).
        </p>
        <p>
          When you create a Listing, you may also choose to include certain requirements which must be met by the Members who are eligible to request a Order of your Meal Package, such as requiring Members to have a verified phone number, in order to book your Meal Package. Any Member wishing to book Meal Packages included in Listings with such requirements must meet these requirements. More information on how to set such requirements is available via the "Chefing" section of the Site, Application and Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a Chef, Just Booked makes certain tools available to you to help you to make informed decisions about which Members you choose to confirm or pre-approve for Order for your Meal Package. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Chef, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who consume the Meal Package.
        </p>
        <p>
          JustBooked may offer Home Chefs the option of having photographers take photographs of their Meal Packages. If you as a Home Chef choose to have a photographer do this, the photographs taken will be made available to you to include in your Listing with a watermark or tag bearing the words "JustBooked.com Verified Photo" or similar wording ("Verified Images"). You agree that you alone are responsible for ensuring that your Listing is accurately represented in the Verified Images. You alone are responsible for using the Verified Images and you warrant that you will cease to use the Verified Images or any other images if such images cease to accurately represent your Listing. All images, materials and content created by these photographers, including Verified Images, constitute JustBooked Content, regardless of whether you include them in your Listing. You agree that JustBooked may use the Verified Images for advertising, marketing, commercial and other business purposes in any media or platform, whether in relation to your Listing or otherwise, without further notice or compensation.</p>
        <p>
          No Endorsement</p>
        <p>
          Just Booked does not endorse any Member or any Meal Package. You understand that Verified Images are intended only to indicate a photographic representation of the Meal Package at the time the photograph was taken. Verified Images are therefore not an endorsement by Just Booked of any Member or any Meal Package. Members are required by these Terms to provide accurate information, and although Just Booked may undertake additional checks and processes designed to help verify or check the identities or backgrounds of users, we do not make any representations about, confirm, or endorse any Member or the Member's purported identity or background.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any references in the Site, Application or Services to a Member being "verified" or "connected" (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification process, and does not represent anything else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by Just Booked about any Member, including of the Member's identity and whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. Instead, any such description is intended to be useful information for you to evaluate when you make your own decisions about the identity and suitability of others whom you contact or interact with via the Site, Application and Services. We therefore recommend that you always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to use a Chef or to accept a Order request from a User, or to have any other interaction with any other Member. Except as provided in the Just Booked Chef Guarantee Terms and Conditions ("Just Booked Chef Guarantee"), which is an agreement between Just Booked and Chefs, we are not responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your interactions with other Members.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using the Site, Application or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm. You agree not to attempt to impose liability on or seek any legal remedy from Just Booked with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with other Members on the Site and Services regarding any Orders or Listings made by you. This limitation shall not apply to any claim by a Chef against Just Booked regarding the remittance of payments received from a User by Just Booked on behalf of a Chef, which instead shall be subject to the limitations described in the section below entitled "Limitation of Liability".
        </p>
        <p>
          Orders and Financial Terms
        </p>
        <p>
          Key definitions</p>
        <p>
          "Meal Package Fees" means the amounts that are due and payable by a User in exchange for that User's usage of a Meal Package. The Chef alone, and not Just Booked, is responsible for the Meal Package Fees for his or her Listing. The Chef may in his or her sole discretion decide to include in these amounts (i) a cleaning fee or any other fee permitted on the Just Booked platform, or (ii) Taxes that the Chef determines that he or she has to collect.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Just Booked Fees" means the fee that Just Booked charges a Chef for the use of the Services, which is calculated as a percentage of the applicable Meal Package Fees. The Just Booked Fees will be displayed to the Chef when the Chef is asked whether to confirm or reject a Order request from a prospective User.  
        </p>
        <p>
          "Total Fees" means collectively the Meal Package Fees and the Just Booked Fees plus any Taxes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Orders and Financial Terms for Chefs and Users
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a Chef and a Order is requested for your Meal Package via the Site, Application or Services, you will be required to either confirm or reject the Order request within the Order Request Period (currently set to 24 hours), otherwise the Order request will automatically expire. When a Order is requested via the Site, Application or Services, we will share with you (i) the first and last name of the User who has requested the Order, (ii) a link to the User's Just Booked Account profile page, (iii) if the User and Chef have both connected their Just Booked accounts to SNS, the names of any members of an SNS with whom you are "friends" or associated on the SNS if such individuals are also "friends" or associated with the User on such SNS, and (iv) an indication of whether or not the User has provided other information to Just Booked, such as a verified email address, connection to SNSs, or a government ID. If you are unable to confirm or decide to reject a Order request within the Order Request Period, any amounts collected by Just Booked for the requested Order will be refunded to the applicable User's credit card and any pre-authorization of such credit card will be released. When you confirm a Order requested by a User, Just Booked will send you an email, text message or message via the Application confirming such Order, depending on the selections you make via the Site, Application and Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just Booked will collect the Total Fees at the time of Order confirmation (i.e. when the Chef confirms the Order request) and will initiate payment of the Meal Package Fees (Total Fees less Just Booked Fees and any Taxes in respect of the Total Fees, such as HST in Canada or VAT in Europe) to the Chef within 48 hours of when the User uses the applicable Meal Package (except to the extent that a refund is due to the User). The time it takes for the Chef to receive payouts may depend upon the payout method chosen by the Chef. Some methods involve the use of third-party payment processors, who may impose their own additional charges for the use of their services on the Chef, including by deducting their charges from the payout amount.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you owe or agree to pay any amount to Just Booked (whether as a result of your Orders or actions as a User or otherwise), then Just Booked may (but is not obliged to) withhold the amount owing to Just Booked from any payout amounts due to you as a Chef, and use the withheld amount to setoff the amount owed by you to Just Booked. If Just Booked does so, then your obligation to pay Just Booked will be extinguished to the extent of the amount withheld by Just Booked, and Just Booked will cease to owe to you any obligations (including, but not limited to, any obligation to pay you) with respect to the amount withheld. In addition to the amount due, if your account is delinquent or you otherwise have chargebacks on your account, you may be charged fees that are incidental to our collection of these delinquent amounts and chargebacks. Such fees or charges may include collection fees, convenience fees, or other third party charges. You hereby explicitly agree that all communication in relation to delinquent accounts will be made by electronic mail or by phone, as provided to Just Booked by you. Such communication may be made by Just Booked or by anyone on its behalf, including but not limited to a third party collection agent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Appointment of Just Booked as Limited Payment Collection Agent for Chef
        </p>
        <p>
          Each Chef hereby appoints Just Booked as the Chef's limited payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting the Meal Package Fees from Users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each Chef agrees that payment made by a User through Just Booked, shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Chef, and the Chef will make the Meal Package available to the User in the agreed-upon manner as if the Chef has received the Meal Package Fees. Each Chef agrees that Just Booked may, in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Chef and reflected in the relevant Listing, (i) permit the User to cancel the Order and (ii) refund (via Just Booked) to the User that portion of the Meal Package Fees specified in the applicable cancellation policy. Each Chef understands that as Just Booked accepts payments from Users as the Chef's limited payment collection agent and that Just Booked' obligation to pay the Chef is subject to and conditional upon successful receipt of the associated payments from Users. Just Booked does not guarantee payments to Chefs for amounts that have not been successfully received by Just Booked from Users. In accepting appointment as the limited authorized agent of the Chef, Just Booked assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Chef.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that Just Booked does not currently charge fees for the creation of Listings. However, you as a Chef acknowledge and agree that Just Booked reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge you for and collect fees from you for the creation of Listings. Please note that Just Booked will provide notice of any Listing fee collection via the Site, Application and Services, prior to implementing such a Listing fee feature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Orders and Financial Terms for Users
        </p>
        <p>
          The Chefs, not Just Booked, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed Orders and making available any Meal Packages reserved through the Site, Application and Services. If you, as a User, choose to enter into a transaction with a Chef for the Order of a Meal Package, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the Chef and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Meal Package imposed by the Chef. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Just Booked, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that Just Booked is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its payment obligations hereunder, Just Booked disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements. You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that Just Booked is not a party to the agreement between you and the Chef, Just Booked acts as the Chef's payment collection agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Chef. Upon your payment of the Total Fees to Just Booked, your payment obligation to the Chef for the Meal Package Fees is extinguished, and Just Booked is responsible for remitting the Meal Package Fees (less the Just Booked Fees and any Taxes in respect of the Just Booked Fees, such as HST in Canada or VAT in Europe), in the manner described in these Terms. In the event that Just Booked does not remit any such amounts as described in these Terms, such Chef will have recourse only against such Just Booked entity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Total Fees payable will be displayed to a User before the User sends a Order request to a Chef. As noted above, the Chef is required to either confirm or reject the Order request within the Order Request Period; otherwise, the requested Order will be automatically cancelled. If a requested Order is cancelled (i.e. not confirmed by the applicable Chef), any amounts collected by Just Booked will be refunded to such User, depending on the selections the User makes via the Site and Application, and any pre-authorization of such User's credit card will be released, if applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          You as a User agree to pay Just Booked for the Total Fees for any Order requested in connection with your Just Booked Account if such requested Orders are confirmed by the applicable Chef. In order to establish a Order pending the applicable Chef's confirmation of your requested Order, you understand and agree that Just Booked, on behalf of the Chef, reserve the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorization via your credit card for the Total Fees or (ii) charge your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed one dollar ($1), or a similar sum in the currency in which you are transacting (e.g. one euro or one British pound), to verify your credit card. As a general rule, Just Booked will collect the Total Fees due once Just Booked receives confirmation of your Order from the applicable Chef; if necessary, Total Fees may instead be collected at a later point. Please note that Just Booked cannot control any fees that may be charged to a User by his or her bank related to Just Booked's collection of the Total Fees, and Just Booked disclaims all liability in this regard.
        </p>
        <p>
          In connection with your requested Order, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Just Booked or its third-party payment processor(s). You agree to pay Just Booked for any confirmed Orders made in connection with your Just Booked Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the Site or Application, e.g. by PayPal or credit card. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the Order, either directly by Just Booked or indirectly, via a third-party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Site or Application. You also authorize Just Booked to charge your credit card in the event of damage caused at a Meal Package as contemplated under "Damage to Meal Packages" below and for Security Deposits, if applicable. If you are directed to Just Booked' third-party payment processor(s), you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party's service and that third party's personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. Once your confirmed Order transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed Order.

        <p>
          Cancellations and Refunds</p>
        <p>
          If, as a User, you cancel your requested Order before the requested Order is confirmed by a Chef, Just Booked Payments will cancel any pre-authorization to your credit card and/or refund any nominal amounts charged to your credit card in connection with the requested Order within a commercially reasonable time. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If, as a User, you wish to cancel a confirmed Order made via the Site, Application and Services, prior to 48 hours of the Meal Package event date, Just Booked Payments will refund you for the Total Fees charged to your credit card in connection with the confirmed Order within a commercially reasonable time. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Within 48 hours of the Meal Package event date, there is no ability to cancel a confirmed Order made via the Site, Application and Services. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If a Chef cancels a confirmed Order made via the Site, Services, and Application, (i) Just Booked Payments will refund the Total Fees for such Order to the applicable User within a commercially reasonable time of the cancellation and (ii) the User will receive an email or other communication from Just Booked containing alternative Listings and other related information. If the User requests a Order from one of the alternative Listings and the Chef associated with such alternative Listing confirms the User's requested Order, then the User agrees to pay Just Booked the Total Fees relating to the confirmed Order for the Meal Package in the alternative Listing, in accordance with these Terms. If a Chef cancelled a confirmed Order and you, as a User, have not received an email or other communication from Just Booked, please contact Just Booked.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, as a Chef, you cancel a confirmed Order, you agree that Just Booked may apply penalties or consequences to you or your Listing, including (i) publishing an automated review on your Listing indicating that a reservation was cancelled, (ii) keeping the calendar for your Listing unavailable or blocked for the dates of the cancelled Order, or (iii) imposing a cancellation fee (to be withheld from your future payouts or charged to the credit card on file in your Just Booked Account). You will be notified of the situations in which a cancellation fee applies before you decide to cancel.
        </p>
        <p>
          In certain circumstances, Just Booked may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary or desirable to cancel a confirmed Order made via the Site, Application and Services. This may be for reasons set forth in Just Booked's Extenuating Circumstances policy or for any other reason. Just Booked Payments may also determine, in its sole discretion, to refund to the User part or all of the amounts charged to the User in accordance with the User Refund Policy. You agree that Just Booked and the relevant User or Chef will not have any liability for such cancellations or refunds.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, as a Chef, your User cancels a confirmed Order or Just Booked decides that it is necessary to cancel a confirmed Order, and Just Booked issues a refund to the User in accordance with the User Refund Policy or other applicable cancellation policies, you agree that in the event you have already been paid Just Booked shall be entitled to recover the amount of any such User refund from you, including by subtracting such refund amount out from any future Meal Package Fees due to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rounding Off</p>
        <p>
          Just Booked may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down amounts that are payable from or to Users or Chefs to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the currency is denominated (e.g. to the nearest dollar, euro or other supported currency); for example, Just Booked will round up an amount of $101.50 to $102.00, and $101.49 to $101.00.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some currencies are denominated in large numbers. In those cases, Just Booked may determine the functional base unit in which those currencies are denominated to be 10, 100 or 1,000 of the currency; the corresponding examples for such currencies would be for Just Booked to round up an amount of 1,045 up to 1,050 and 1,044 down to 1,040, or 35,450 up to 35,500 and 35,449 down to 35,400, or 837,500 up to 838,000 and 837,499 down to 837,000.
        </p>
        <p>
          Payment Processing Errors</p>
        <p>
          We will take steps to rectify any payment processing errors that we become aware of. These steps may include crediting or debiting (as appropriate) the same payment method used for the original payout to or payment by you, so that you end up receiving or paying the correct amount. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Taxes
        </p>
        <p>
          Tax regulations may require us to collect appropriate tax information from our Chefs, or to withhold taxes from payouts to Chefs, or both. For instance, IRS regulations stipulate that we must collect an IRS Form W-9 from our US Chefs, and an appropriate IRS Form W-8 (e.g. Form W-8BEN) from non-US Chefs with at least one Listing in the US. You as a Chef are solely responsible for keeping the information in your tax forms current, complete and accurate. If you as a Chef fail to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to alleviate our obligation (if any) to withhold taxes from payments to you (e.g. where you are a US Chef and you fail to provide us with a completed IRS Form W-9), we reserve the right in our sole discretion to freeze all payouts to you until resolution, to withhold such amounts as required by law, or to do both.
        </p>
        <p>
          You as a Chef understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining (i) your applicable Tax reporting requirements, and (ii) the Taxes that should be included, and for including Taxes to be collected or obligations relating to applicable Taxes in Listings. You are also solely responsible for remitting to the relevant authority any Taxes included or received by you. Just Booked cannot and does not offer Tax-related advice to any Members.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where applicable, or based upon request from a Chef, Just Booked may issue a valid VAT invoice to such Chef.
        </p>
        <p>
          You understand and acknowledge that appropriate governmental agencies, departments or authorities (the "Tax Authority") where your Meal Package is located may require Taxes to be collected from Users or Chefs on the amount paid for the right to use and/or occupancy of accommodations, and to be remitted to the respective Tax Authority. The laws in jurisdictions may vary, but these taxes may be required to be collected and remitted as a percentage of the rent or Meal Package Fees set by Chefs, a set amount per day, or other variations, and are sometimes called "occupancy taxes," "hotel taxes," "lodging taxes," "transient taxes," "sales and use taxes," "value added taxes," "room taxes" or "tourist taxes" (hereafter, "Occupancy Taxes").
        </p>
        <p>
          Damage to the Home</p>
        <p>
          As a User, you are responsible for leaving the Home  in the condition it was in when you arrived. You acknowledge and agree that, as a User, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals whom you invite to, or otherwise provide access to, the Home . In the event that a Chef claims otherwise and provides evidence of damage, including but not limited to photographs, you agree to pay the cost of replacing the damaged items with equivalent items. After being notified of the claim and given forty eight (48) hours to respond, the payment will be charged to and taken from the credit card on file in your Just Booked Account. Just Booked also reserves the right to charge the credit card on file in your Just Booked Account, or otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any aHome s available to Just Booked in this regard, in situations in which you have been determined, in Just Booked's sole discretion, to have damaged any Home , including, but not limited to, in relation to any payment requests made by Chefs under the Just Booked Chef Guarantee, and in relation to any payments made by Just Booked to Chefs. If we are unable to charge the credit card on file or otherwise collect payment from you, you agree to remit payment for any damage to the Meal Package to the applicable Chef or to Just Booked (if applicable).
        </p>
        <p>
          Both Users and Chefs agree to cooperate with and assist Just Booked in good faith, and to provide Just Booked with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Just Booked, in connection with any complaints or claims made by Members relating to Meal Packages or any personal or other property located at a Home  (including, without limitation, payment requests made under the Just Booked Chef Guarantee) or with respect to any investigation undertaken by Just Booked or a representative of Just Booked regarding use or abuse of the Site, Application or the Services. If you are a User, upon Just Booked's reasonable request, and to the extent you are reasonably able to do so, you agree to participate in mediation or similar resolution process with a Chef, at no cost to you, which process will be conducted by Just Booked or a third party selected by Just Booked or its insurer, with respect to losses for which the Chef is requesting payment from Just Booked under the Just Booked Chef Guarantee.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a User, you understand and agree that Just Booked may make a claim under your homeowner's, renter's or other insurance policy related to any damage or loss that you may have caused or been responsible for or to a Home  or any personal or other property located at a Home   (including without limitation amounts paid by Just Booked under the Just Booked Chef Guarantee). You agree to cooperate with and assist Just Booked in good faith, and to provide Just Booked with such information as may be reasonably requested by Just Booked, in order to make a claim under your homeowner's, renter's or other insurance policy, including, but not limited to, executing documents and taking such further acts as Just Booked may reasonably request to assist Just Booked in accomplishing the foregoing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overstaying without the Home Chef's Consent</p>
        <p>
          Users agree that a confirmed reservation is merely a license granted by the Chef to the User to enter and use the Listing for the limited duration of the confirmed reservation and in accordance with the User's agreement with the Chef. Users further agree to leave the Home  no later than allotted time that the Chef specifies in the Listing or such other time as mutually agreed upon between the Chef and User. If a User stays past the agreed upon checkout time without the Chef's consent, they no longer have a license to occupy Home  and the Chef is entitled to make the User leave. In addition, Users agree that the Chef can charge the User, for each 1 hour period that the User stays over the agreed period without the Chef's consent, an additional  fee of two times the average Meal Package Fee originally paid by the User to cover the inconvenience suffered by the Chef, plus all applicable Service Fees, Taxes, and any legal expenses incurred by the Chef to make the User leave (collectively, "Additional Sums"). Users agree that Just Booked , in its role as limited collection agent for the Chef, shall charge the User's credit card or other payment methods it has on file to collect these Additional Sums. In addition, Just Booked may recover any costs and expenses it incurs in collecting the Additional Sums by charging the User's credit card or other payment method on file.
        </p>
        <p>
          Foreign Currency</p>
        <p>
          Just Booked's online platform facilitates Orders between Users and Chefs who may prefer to pay and to receive payments in different currencies, which may require foreign currency conversions to accommodate these differing currency preferences. Although the Just Booked platform may allow users to view the price of Listings in a number of currencies, the currencies available for users to make and receive payments may be limited, and may not include the default currency in any given geographic location.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each foreign currency conversion is processed at a foreign currency conversion rate. This rate generally refers to the amount of one currency that must be paid to buy a certain amount of another currency at a given time. For example, if it costs US$125.00 to buy €100.00, the currency conversion rate of US dollars to Euros would be 1.25, and the currency conversion rate from Euros to US dollars would be 0.8. Currency conversion rates will vary from time to time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Key definitions</p>
        <p>
          "Display Currency" means the currency in which users view Listing prices on the Just Booked platform. Users may be able to choose and change the Display Currency in order to view the pricing for a Listing in a number of different supported currencies.  
        </p>
        <p>
          "Order Currency" means the currency in which a User has to pay for his or her Order. At the time the User submits a Order request, the Just Booked platform will select the Order Currency, based on the User's country of origin and the payment methods available for that country. Just Booked supports only a certain number of currencies as Order Currencies. The Order Currency for a Order may be different from the relevant Listing Currency.  
        </p>
        <p>
          "Listing Currency" means the currency in which a Listing's price is set. The Listing Currency is set by the Chef.  
        </p>
        <p>
          "Payout Currency" means the currency in which a Chef's payout will be paid to the Chef. The Payout Currency is set by the Chef.  
        </p>
        <p>
          "Base Exchange Rate" means a system-wide rate used by Just Booked for foreign currency conversion that is in effect at the time the foreign currency conversion is processed, and does not include any fee or mark-up by Just Booked. Just Booked establishes the Base Exchange Rate using data from one or more third parties such as OANDA (http://www.oanda.com).  
        </p>
        <p>
          "Adjusted Exchange Rate" means a rate for foreign currency conversion that is calculated by adding a mark-up to the Base Exchange Rate. This mark-up represents a charge imposed by Just Booked for its holding costs and foreign currency risks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Foreign currency conversions on the Just Booked platform
        </p>
        <p>
          Just Booked will process a foreign currency conversion in the following situations:
        </p>
        <p>
          • The Display Currency is different from the Listing Currency when a user views a Listing: Just Booked will calculate the estimated Total Fees in the Display Currency, by applying either the Base Exchange Rate or the Adjusted Exchange Rate at the time of the view to the estimated Total Fees in the Listing Currency. The Adjusted Exchange Rate will be applied if the Display Currency is a supported Order Currency, and it is different from the Listing Currency. Otherwise, the Base Exchange Rate will be applied.
        </p>
        <p>
          • The Order Currency is different from the Listing Currency when a User submits a Order request for a Listing: Just Booked will calculate the Total Fees in the Order Currency, by applying either the Base Exchange Rate or the Adjusted Exchange Rate at the time of the Order request to the Total Fees in the Listing Currency. The User will be able to view the actual exchange rate applied. The User Fee, which is a percentage of the applicable Meal Package Fees, will be calculated based on the Meal Package Fees in the Order Currency (i.e. after conversion from the Listing Currency). The Adjusted Exchange Rate will be applied if the Display Currency is the same as the Order Currency, and it is different from the Listing Currency for the Listing. Otherwise, the Base Exchange Rate will be applied.
        </p>
        <p>
          • The Payout Currency is different from the Listing Currency when Just Booked initiates a payout: generally, Just Booked will calculate the payout to the Chef, by applying the Base Exchange Rate on the date that Just Booked initiates the payout to the Meal Package Fees (less Just Booked' Fees and any Taxes in respect of the Chef Fees, such as VAT in Europe) in the Listing Currency. The Chef will be able to view the actual exchange rate applied in his or her transaction history in the Site or Application. In some cases where the payout method selected by the Chef involves certain third-party payment processors (such as Western Union), (i) Just Booked will send the payout amount to the processor in a major currency (e.g. US dollars), by applying the relevant Base Exchange Rate for the Listing Currency to that major currency, (ii) the Chef will be able to view the payout amount sent by Just Booked in that major currency in his or her transaction history in the Site or Application, and (iii) the processor will calculate the actual payout to the Chef by applying its own foreign currency conversion rate for that major currency to the Payout Currency.
        </p>
        <p>
          • When a confirmed Order is modified or cancelled, and there had been a foreign currency conversion when the Order was submitted: the foreign currency conversion for any additional payments required of the User or any refund to the User will be processed at the same rate as applied to the earlier payment by the User.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you as a User submit a Order request for a Listing, you will be able to view the actual exchange rate used to calculate the Total Fees in the Order Currency. Where the Adjusted Exchange Rate is applied, you will be able to view the mark-up included in the rate. The actual exchange rate (and any mark-up included in the rate) will also be stated in the billing receipt for your Order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just Booked updates the Base Exchange Rate on a regular basis, but not on a real-time basis. In particular, Just Booked does not always change the Base Exchange Rate immediately when its costs of foreign exchange change. Accordingly, the Base Exchange Rate may not be identical to the applicable market rate in effect at the specific time a foreign currency conversion is processed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that your payment company (for example, your credit or bank card issuer) will use a currency conversion rate for and may impose a currency conversion fee on your payment or payout, if your card or bank account is denominated in a currency that is different from the Order Currency or the Payout Currency respectively. Similarly, third-party payment processors may also use a currency conversion rate for or impose a currency conversion fee on your payment or payout. All of these currency conversion rates and fees are not controlled by or known to Just Booked.

          You and Just Booked agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of the Site or Application (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Just Booked are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Just Booked otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms.

          Arbitration Rules and Governing Law. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arbitration Process. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration and a separate form for California residents) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.

          Arbitration Location and Procedure. Unless you and Just Booked otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Just Booked submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.

        <p>
          Arbitrator's Decision. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Just Booked will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fees. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Just Booked will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
        </p>
        <p>
          Changes. Notwithstanding the provisions of the "Modification" section above, if Just Booked changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last Updated Date" above or in the date of Just Booked's email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Just Booked in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).

          General</p>
        <p>
          The failure of Just Booked to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Just Booked. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

          Third party beneficiary</p>

          These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that the payment card networks are third party beneficiaries of these Terms for purposes of enforcing provisions related to payments, but that their consent or agreement is not necessary for any changes or modifications to these Terms.
